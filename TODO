TODO:
    -   Find some way to always pass certain vars to templates. Constantly
        passing the 'topusers' and 'topscripts' is annoying. Perhaps base.html
        can retrieve it on its own? (Add last commits)
    -   Main page text.
    -   Login / session
    -   Manage / Create scripts.
    -   Commit API page.
    -   Add additional URLs (/user/:id/scripts)
    -   Charts using matplotlib.
    -   Script Manager integration?
