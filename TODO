FIXME:
    -   Find some way to always pass certain vars to templates. Constantly
        passing the 'topusers' and 'topscripts' is annoying. Perhaps base.html
        can retrieve it on its own?
    -   Clean up UserTool and ScriptTool

TODO:
    -   Charts using matplotlib.
    -   Script Manager integration?
