SRL Stats System. http://wizzup.org/stats/

If you want to run the system, you'll need the following components:
Python (jinja2, sqlalchemy, flup (WSGIServer), matplotlib and possibly numpy)
I used lighttpd, but apache and other should work fine too. The system uses
WSGI/FCGI.

This is my config:

url.rewrite-once = (
                "^/stats" => "stats.fcgi"
        )

# You'll need a file called 'stats.fcgi' in your docroot and symlink it to the
# stats.py.

fastcgi.server += ( ".fcgi" =>
  ( "statsfcgi" =>
    (   
        "socket"        => "/tmp/stats.sock-1",
        "docroot"       => "/home/merlijn/srl-stats"
    )
  )
)

The config.py file contains the base url, you'll probably want to change this.

Also fill in stats_credentials.py:

dbu = 'statsdbuserhere'
dbpwd = 'somepasshere'
dwh = 'localhost'
dbp = '5432' # psql port
dbname = 'statsdbnamehere'

And if you want to use a different database, edit sql.py appropriately. (Change
the engine line)
